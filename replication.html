<h1><b>Semiconservative replication </h1>
<p1>It is crucial that the genetic material is reproduced accurately. When Watson and Crick worked out the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953, they recognized that the complementary nature of the two strands-A paired with T and G paired with C-might play an important role in its replication. Because the two polynucleotide strands are joined only Genetics by hydrogen bonds, they are able to separate without requiring breakage of covalent bonds.

<p2>If the two strands of a parental double helix of DNA are separated, the base sequence of each parental strand could serve as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand, producing two identical progeny double helices. This process is called semiconservative replication because the parental double helix is half conserved, each parental single strand remaining intact. <br>
