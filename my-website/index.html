            <p>DNA replication is the biological process of producing two identical replicas of DNA from one original DNA molecule.<br> DNA replication occurs in all living organisms acting as the most essential part for biological inheritance.<br>

In a cell, DNA replication begins at specific locations or origins of replication in the genome.<br>

Unwinding of DNA and synthesis of new strands takes place by an enzyme known as helicase which results in the formation of replication forks, growing bi-directionally from the origin.<br> 

Various proteins are associated with the replication fork to help in the initiation and continuation of DNA synthesis.<br>

Most prominently, DNA polymerase synthesizes the new strands by adding nucleotides that complement each (template) strand.<br> 

DNA replication occurs during the S-stage of Interphase.<br>
