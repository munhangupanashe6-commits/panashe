<h1><b>Enzymes involved</h1>
<p1>DNA helicase- Also known as helix destabilizing enzyme. Helicase separates the two strands of DNA at the Replication Fork behind the topoisomerase.

DNA polymerase- The enzyme responsible for catalyzing the addition of nucleotide substrates to DNA in the 5 to 3 prime direction during DNA replication. Also performs proof-reading and error correction. There exist many different types of DNA Polymerase, each of which performs different functions in different types of cells.

DNA clamp- A protein which prevents elongating DNA polymerases from dissociating from the DNA parent strand.

Single-strand DNA-binding protein- Bind to ssDNA and prevent the DNA double helix from re-annealing after DNA helicase unwinds it, thus maintaining the strand separation, and facilitating the synthesis of the nascent strand.<br>
<br><h>  Eukaryotes vs Prokaryotes</h>
<p>There is much conservation between the two systems, in as much as the enzymology, the replication 
fork geometry, the basic fundamental features and the use of multi-protein machinery are all very 
much the same in both.   
However, there are more protein components in the Eukaryotic replication machinery. 
In prokaryotes, the replication form moves 10x faster than in eukaryotes.
